Goal was to create an entire website using a Grid Css layout. Challenges included getting a repsonsive header with grid and fitting images (screenshots) into the item area without the formatting going off the rails, especially when I added another image on the portfolio page. Used W3 Schools, MDN, CSS Tricks and Tips, and Stack Overflow. I learned from Stack Overflow to use img.wrap and content.wrap to get a consistent sizing. Need to learn mor aboput img src and why using absolute and img src=" /...."  works better than other methods. Tried using some animation to give my home page more pizazze but was unsuccessful so will experiment with that as well.
